## âš¡ Features

- [ ] Upload `.wav` audio files
- [ ] View detailed **waveform plots** (amplitude vs. time)
- [ ] See a **real-time animated spectrogram** (frequency vs. time)
- [ ] Fully browser-based â€“ no installation required
- [ ] Built with ðŸŽ§ Streamlit + NumPy + SciPy + Matplotlib
- [ ] Compatible with embedding via `<iframe>`

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases

- Audio steganography analysis
- Spectral pattern inspection
- CTF and InfoSec audio-related challenges
- Educational tool for learning sound signal properties
- Visualizing how speech or music looks in frequency domain

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- Uses `numpy` and `scipy` to process the WAV file and extract audio data
- Visualizes:
  - **Waveform**: a time-domain plot of the amplitude of the sound
  - **Spectrogram**: a frequency-time representation using STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform)
- Streamlit handles the interactive UI and animations
